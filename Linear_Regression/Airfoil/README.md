Airfoil  Linear Regression
--------------------------

1. Given a NASA data set, obtained from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests
of two and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections. Implement a linear regression
model from scratch using gradient descent to predict scaled sound pressure level.
The various attributes of the data are explained in the file description.txt.
2. Using appropriate plot show how number of iterations is affecting the mean squared
error for above model under below given conditions:
(a) Using 3 different initial regression coefficients (weights) for fixed value of learning parameter (All 3 in single plot).
(b) Using 3 different learning parameters for some fixed initial regression coefficients. (All 3 in single plot)
3. If you want to apply regression on some dataset but one of it’s features has missing
values under below given conditions, how will you approach the problem. (No need
of Code Experimentation)
(a) When 0-0.5% of values are missing of that feature
(b) When 8-10% of values are missing of that feature
(c) When 60-70% of values are missing of that feature
